# Word Frequency Analysis API

This project implements a Python-based API using Django to interact with Wikipedia for specific text analysis tasks. The API consists of two primary endpoints designed to analyze and store the frequency of words in Wikipedia articles based on user queries.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Django 3.x
- Wikipedia API
- NLTK (or other libraries for text analysis)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run database migrations:

   ```
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

4. Start the Django development server:

   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Endpoints

### Word Frequency Analysis Endpoint

- **URL**: /word-frequency-analysis/
- **Method**: POST
- **Parameters**:
  - `topic` (string): The subject of a Wikipedia article.
  - `n` (integer, optional): Number of top frequent words to return (default is 10).
- **Response**: Returns the top `n` most frequent words in a structured format.

### Search History Endpoint

- **URL**: /search-history/
- **Method**: GET
- **Response**: Lists past search results, including the topics searched and the corresponding top frequent words returned by the API.

## Usage

1. Make POST requests to `/word-frequency-analysis/` with the `topic` parameter to analyze a Wikipedia article.
2. Retrieve past search results by making GET requests to `/search-history/`.

## Testing

Unit tests are implemented to validate the functionality and reliability of the API endpoints. Run the tests using the following command:

```
python manage.py test
```
